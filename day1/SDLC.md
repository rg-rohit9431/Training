### SDLC

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used for developing software applications. It consists of several phases, each with specific activities and deliverables.

### Detailed Phases of SDLC

- **Planning**:
  - **Objective**: Establish the project's scope, objectives, and feasibility.
  - **Activities**: Requirement gathering, feasibility study, project planning, resource allocation.
  - **Deliverables**: Project plan, System requirements specification (SRS), feasibility report, requirement specifications.

- **Analysis**:
  - **Objective**: Understand and document the detailed requirements.
  - **Activities**: Requirement analysis, stakeholder meetings, creating use cases.
  - **Deliverables**: System requirements specification (SRS), use case diagrams.

- **Design**:
  - **Objective**: Design the system architecture and components.
  - **Activities**: Architectural design, detailed design, interface design, database design.
  - **Deliverables**: Design documents, data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams.

- **Implementation (or Coding)**:
  - **Objective**: Develop the actual software.
  - **Activities**: Writing code, unit testing, code review.
  - **Deliverables**: Source code, unit test cases.

- **Testing**:
  - **Objective**: Ensure the software is bug-free and meets requirements.
  - **Activities**: System testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing (UAT).
  - **Deliverables**: Test plans, test cases, defect reports.

- **Deployment**:
  - **Objective**: Release the software to users.
  - **Activities**: Installation, configuration, user training.
  - **Deliverables**: Deployed software, user manuals, training materials.

- **Maintenance**:
  - **Objective**: Provide ongoing support and enhancements.
  - **Activities**: Bug fixing, performance tuning, adding new features.
  - **Deliverables**: Updated software, maintenance reports.

### Models of SDLC

- **Waterfall Model**:
  - **Description**: A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
  - **Pros**: Simple to understand and manage, clear milestones.
  - **Cons**: Inflexible, difficult to accommodate changes.

- **V-Model (Validation and Verification)**:
  - **Description**: An extension of the Waterfall model with a corresponding testing phase for each development stage.
  - **Pros**: Emphasizes verification and validation, early detection of defects.
  - **Cons**: Similar inflexibility to the Waterfall model.

- **Iterative Model**:
  - **Description**: Develops the system through repeated cycles (iterations) and smaller portions at a time.
  - **Pros**: Allows for incremental improvements, easier to manage risks.
  - **Cons**: Requires more resources, potential for scope creep.

- **Spiral Model**:
  - **Description**: Combines iterative development with risk management. Each iteration is called a spiral.
  - **Pros**: Focuses on risk analysis, flexible to changes.
  - **Cons**: Can be complex to manage, costly.

- **Agile Model**:
  - **Description**: Emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. Popular methodologies include Scrum and Kanban.
  - **Pros**: Highly flexible, promotes customer collaboration, quick delivery of functional software.
  - **Cons**: Requires active user involvement, can be challenging to predict timelines and budgets.
